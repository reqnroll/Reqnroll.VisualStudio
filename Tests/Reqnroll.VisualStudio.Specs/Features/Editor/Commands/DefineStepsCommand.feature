Feature: Define steps command

Rules:

* Lists all undefined steps
  * There are undefined steps
  * Two undefined step has the same step definition skeleton
* Shows error when all steps defined
  * All steps are defined
* Selected step definition skeletons can be copied to clipboard
  * Selected step definition skeletons are copied to clipboard
* Selected step definitions skeletons can be saved to a new file
  * Selected step definition skeletons are saved to a new file
  * Selected step definition skeletons are saved to a new file in StepDefinitions folder

Scenario: There are undefined steps
	Given there is a Reqnroll project scope

			Then the result is calculated
		"""
	And the project is built and the initial binding discovery is performed
	When I invoke the "Define Steps" command
